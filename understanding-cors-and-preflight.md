# CORS & Preflight Requests – Guide

## 1. Introduction to CORS

**CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security mechanism that allows a server to specify which origins (websites) can access its resources.  
It extends and relaxes the **Same-Origin Policy (SOP)**, which by default blocks requests between different origins to protect user data.

### Why CORS Exists
Without CORS (or SOP), any website could send requests to another website where you're logged in (e.g., your bank) and perform actions without permission — a major security risk.

---

## 2. Same-Origin Policy (SOP) Recap

Two URLs share the **same origin** if their:
- **Protocol** (http/https)  
- **Domain** (example.com)  
- **Port** (e.g., 443 for HTTPS)  
are identical.

**Example:**
- `https://app.example.com` → can request from `https://app.example.com/api` ✅
- `https://app.example.com` → cannot directly request from `https://api.example.com` ❌ (different subdomain)

SOP allows:
- **GET** and **POST** requests from forms to any origin, but blocks JavaScript from reading the response if cross-origin.
- Does **not** allow `PUT`, `DELETE`, or custom headers to be sent cross-origin without special permission.

---

## 3. What is a CORS Request?

When a frontend hosted at one origin requests data from a backend at a different origin, the browser considers it **cross-origin**.

Example:
```text
Frontend: https://myapp.com
Backend:  https://api.example.com
```

If allowed, the backend must respond with headers like:

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://myapp.com
If the header is missing or the origin doesn’t match, the browser blocks the response.

## 4. Types of CORS Requests

### 4.1 Simple Requests
A request is **simple** if it meets **all** of these conditions:

- **Method** is one of:
  - `GET`
  - `POST`
  - `HEAD`
- **No custom headers** (only safe headers like `Accept`, `Content-Type`, `Accept-Language`)
- **Content-Type** is one of:
  - `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
  - `multipart/form-data`
  - `text/plain`

**Flow for Simple Request:**
1. Browser sends the request directly to the server.
2. Server responds with CORS headers.
3. Browser enforces CORS policy (allows or blocks reading the response).

### 4.2 Preflight Requests
A **preflight request** is triggered when a cross-origin request **does not qualify** as a simple request.  
It happens in cases like:

- Using HTTP methods other than `GET`, `POST`, or `HEAD` (e.g., `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`)
- Sending **custom headers** (e.g., `Authorization`, `X-API-Key`)
- Using a `Content-Type` other than:
  - `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
  - `multipart/form-data`
  - `text/plain`

**Flow for Preflight Request:**
1. Browser sends an **`OPTIONS` request** to the server (preflight request).
2. Server responds with CORS headers specifying:
   - Allowed origins
   - Allowed methods
   - Allowed headers
3. If the response allows it, the browser sends the **actual request**.
4. Browser enforces CORS policy (allows or blocks reading the response).

## 5. Why Preflight Requests Are Important
- Prevents potentially destructive requests (like deleting data) from being sent to servers that haven’t explicitly allowed them.
- Adds a safety check before user data–affecting actions.
- Respects older backend assumptions from SOP (Same Origin Policy) days — that some methods would never come from cross-origins.

---

## 6. Configuring CORS

### Node.js (Express Example)
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();

// Allow all origins
app.use(cors());

// Restrict to specific origin
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'https://myapp.com',
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
  credentials: true
}));

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running'));
```

## 7. Handling CORS Without Backend Changes
- **Proxy server:** Send requests through your own server to make them same-origin.
- **CORS browser extensions:** For local development/testing only.
- **API Gateway:** Configure CORS policies at gateway level (e.g., AWS API Gateway).

---

## 8. CORS vs CSRF
- **CORS:** Controls which origins can access resources.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** Tricks an authenticated user into sending unwanted requests.
- CORS does **not** protect against CSRF — use CSRF tokens or same-site cookies.

## Key CORS Response Headers

### 1. Access-Control-Allow-Origin
Specifies which origins are allowed to access the resource.

**Example:**
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://myapp.com

Can be `*` (all origins) for public APIs (only if not sending credentials).

**Real-life analogy:** Like a guest list at an event — only listed guests are allowed in.

---

### 2. Access-Control-Allow-Methods
Lists HTTP methods the server allows for cross-origin requests.

**Example:**
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

**Real-life analogy:** Tells guests what activities they can do — coffee & snacks only (GET, POST) or full dining (PUT, DELETE).

---

### 3. Access-Control-Allow-Headers
Specifies which request headers the client is allowed to send.

**Example:**
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization

Required if the request uses custom headers not in the default safe list.

---

### 4. Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
Indicates whether the server allows credentials (cookies, HTTP authentication) to be sent.

**Example:**
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

**Important rule:** Cannot use Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *

when `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is `true`.

**Why?** Because Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * means any website can access the resource.

Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true means you’re willing to send cookies, tokens, or HTTP authentication along with the request.

If both are enabled together, you’d be allowing any random site to make authenticated requests on behalf of a logged-in user — this is a huge security risk.

---

## Why it Works in Postman or curl but Not in the Browser

### Role of the Browser
- Browsers enforce the Same-Origin Policy (SOP) for security.
- When a browser detects a cross-origin request, it checks CORS headers before allowing the response to be accessed by JavaScript.
- If headers are missing or invalid → browser blocks access and shows a CORS error.

### Why Postman / curl Ignore CORS
- Postman, curl, and other API clients are not browsers — they do not enforce SOP or CORS rules.
- They directly send the request and show the raw response from the server.
- **Analogy:** Browsers are like security guards checking guest passes. Postman is like the chef in the kitchen — it doesn’t go through the guard at all.

# PRACTICAL INVESTIGATION
## Case 1: Simple GET (No Preflight, Allowed)

**Description:**  
A cross-origin `GET` request to a permissive API with  
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.  
This meets the criteria for a *simple request* (no custom headers, allowed method).

**Observed in Network Tab:**  
- **Main CORS request:**  
  - Method: `GET`  
  - URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`  
  - Status: `200` / `304` (success)  
  - No `OPTIONS` request observed → no preflight.

- **Other entries (ignored for CORS test):**  
  - `index.html` (Status `304`) → HTML page load  
  - `favicon.ico` (Status `404`) → Missing icon  
  - `ws` (Status `101`) → WebSocket handshake, unrelated to CORS

**Outcome:**  
Request succeeded.  
CORS headers present:  
```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

## Case 2 – Simple POST that avoids preflight (Allowed)

**Description:**  
This case sends a POST request with a **"simple" Content-Type** (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).  
Because it meets the criteria for a **Simple Request** (method = POST, no custom headers, safe Content-Type),  
the browser **does not trigger a preflight OPTIONS request**.

**Request:**  
POST (form) → `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`

**Observed Outcome:** ✅ **SUCCESS**  
```json
{
  "title": "hello",
  "body": "test",
  "id": 101
}
```

**Real-life analogy:**## Understanding the Preflight OPTIONS Request in Case 3

When the browser detected a **non-simple POST** (with `Content-Type: application/json`), it sent an **OPTIONS** request first to check if the server allows this request.

### Request Details:
- **Method:** OPTIONS  
- **URL:** https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts  
- **Origin:** http://127.0.0.1:5500  
- **Access-Control-Request-Method:** POST  
- **Access-Control-Request-Headers:** content-type  

This tells the server:
> "I want to make a POST request with a `Content-Type: application/json` header. Do you allow this from my origin?"

---

### Response Details:
- **Status:** 201-Created successfully and 204 No Content → The server allowed the request (no body returned).
- **Access-Control-Allow-Origin:** http://127.0.0.1:5500  
- **Access-Control-Allow-Methods:** GET, HEAD, PUT, PATCH, POST, DELETE  
- **Access-Control-Allow-Headers:** content-type  
- **Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:** true  

This tells the browser:
> "Yes, your origin is allowed to send a POST request with `content-type` header. Credentials (like cookies) are also allowed."

---

### Why 204?
The **preflight request** only checks permissions; it doesn’t send or receive actual data, so the server returns **204 No Content** — meaning “approved, but nothing to show.”

---

## Case 4: Preflight + Credentials (Blocked)

In this case, we make a **non-simple POST** request **with credentials** (`credentials: 'include'`), meaning cookies or HTTP authentication would be sent.

### Why This is Blocked:
- The server responds with:
  ```http
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

# Case 4 – Preflight + Credentials

## Original Scenario

**Fetch code:**
```javascript
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ title: 'hello' }),
  credentials: 'include' // forbidden with ACAO: *
});
```

## Expected Behavior (Theory)

This should trigger a preflight OPTIONS request because:

- Method is POST with `application/json` content type → non-simple request.
- `credentials: 'include'` is used → requires `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.
- The server (jsonplaceholder) sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` — which is not allowed when sending credentials.
- Browser should block the actual request.

## What Actually Happened

In our test, the browser did not show a CORS block in the console. Likely because:

- The server ignored the credentials.
- Browser proceeded but didn’t send any cookies/auth info, so no credential check was enforced.
- jsonplaceholder API is public and may not enforce strict credential rules.

## What I Tried Next

We simulated this scenario on our own server to see the real blocking behavior.

## Broken Version (Reproducing the Block)

**Server code:**
```javascript
res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*');
res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true'); // ❌ Invalid with "*"

```
This configuration violates the CORS rule:
If Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is true, the origin must be explicit, not *.

Result:

Browser sends preflight OPTIONS request.

Browser blocks the actual POST request before sending, showing a CORS error.

## Fixed Version (Allowing Credentials)

**Server code:**
```javascript
const allowedOrigin = 'http://127.0.0.1:5500';
res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', allowedOrigin);
res.setHeader('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', 'true');
```
I have Set the allowed origin explicitly instead of *.

Preflight request now passes.

Browser sends the actual POST request with credentials.

Response is successfully read by JavaScript.

## Key Learnings from Case 4

- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` cannot be used when `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.
- With `credentials: 'include'`, the origin must be explicit.
- Public APIs (like jsonplaceholder) often ignore credentials, so the browser won’t show a block unless credentials actually matter to the server.
- Testing with your own backend helps reproduce & understand CORS errors.

## Real-life analogy

It’s like trying to enter a VIP lounge (credentials) with a ticket that says "Anyone can enter" (`*`). The security guard (browser) says:  
*"If this is VIP access, I need to see a specific name on the guest list, not 'Everyone'."*

# Real-World CORS Problem – Learning from a Developer

## Problem  
A senior developer shared an experience where their web application’s frontend could not communicate with a backend API due to CORS errors. The issue occurred because the backend was not correctly configured to allow cross-origin requests with credentials, causing failed requests when users tried to authenticate.

## Solution Taken  
The developer identified the problem by checking browser console errors and network requests, noticing the absence of proper CORS headers. They fixed it by:

- Setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the exact frontend URL instead of using `*`.  
- Adding `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` to enable cookie-based authentication.  
- Ensuring the backend responded correctly to preflight OPTIONS requests.  
- Testing the configuration thoroughly in staging before production deployment.

## My Takeaway  
I learned that CORS issues often arise due to misconfigured headers, especially when credentials are involved. It’s crucial to explicitly specify allowed origins and handle preflight requests correctly. Next time, I would ensure backend CORS settings are aligned with frontend requests early in development to avoid such issues.
